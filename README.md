# Crowd FundRaiser Smart Contract

Welcome to CFR Smart Contract i.e. crowd fund raiser system built on polygon using solidity and deployed on replit. 

## Description

In real world we often get to see people or groups posting advertisements for raising funds to fulfil particular tasks. They might need money for medical support, educational loan anything... 
This project is the decentralized system that fulfills that gap between the one who requests and the contributors.

## How it works

The one who deploys contract will become the manager of the event. Only he can register requests (description, the wallet address of receipient who wants fund, and total value). The request with more than 50% votes will get aided by crowd collected fund

## Examples

Let's say there are three requests :

1. Raising fund for a startup
2. Educational loan
3. Finance for medical support

and let's say there are 4 contributors. 3 of them vote for the request 3 and 1 votes for the cause 1. So as per the condition set in the solidity program the request 3 will be funded the crowd pool collected money. And that request is funded by manager only.
